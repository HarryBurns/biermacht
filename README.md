### Contribution guidelines ###

I'm very open to contributions from the community.  If you'd like to add a new feature, make sure there is an issue raised for it first, and that you agree the new feature / bugfix with me before beginning coding.  This will maximize the chances that your PR will be accepted.

Once you've agreed the fix and you'd like to get started coding:
  - Fork `biermacht` into your own repo and make your code changes there.
  - You can use the provided [code-style-settings.jar](https://github.com/caseydavenport/biermacht/tree/master/android-studio) resource for Android Studio to auto-format your code.
  - When you're done, create a pull request against this repo.
  - Respond to any feedback on the pull request.
  - Before merging, squash you commits into a single commit with a descriptive message.
  - Your code will be merged!

### Who do I talk to? ###
